## 🌟 Overview

When studying on multiple devices (such as preparing Watchtower articles or meeting parts on an iPad, taking field service notes on an iPhone, and conducting in-depth research on a laptop), your study data becomes fragmented.

**JW Library Backup Merger** solves this by unifying all your `.jwlibrary` backups into a single master backup file directly in your browser.

- 🔒 **Zero Server Uploads:** Your notes and personal data never leave your computer or phone. Everything runs locally in browser memory via **WebAssembly SQLite (`sql.js`)**.
- ⚡ **Multi-Paragraph Highlight Healing:** Accurately retains multi-verse and multi-paragraph highlight spans that other tools truncate.
- 📱 **All Devices Supported:** Apple (iPadOS, iOS, macOS), Android phones & tablets, and Windows PC.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔒 **100% In-Browser Privacy** | Merges SQLite databases in browser RAM. No servers, no tracking, works completely offline. |
| 🛡️ **Highlight Span Healing** | Retains all `BlockRange` rows associated with each `UserMarkGuid` across multi-paragraph highlights. |
| 🏷️ **Smart Conflict Resolution** | Full additive union for distinct highlights, bookmarks, and tags. Last-modified wins for note timestamp collisions. |
| 🧩 **Dynamic Schema Adaptation** | Automatically adapts across database schema versions (e.g. v14, v15, v16 with `Specialty`, `Edition` columns). |
| 🖼️ **Media & Attached Images** | Extracts and preserves custom playlist thumbnails, photo attachments, and notes artwork. |
| 📱 **Device Recognition** | Automatically detects and badges iPads, iPhones, Android devices, and Windows PCs. |
| 🔍 **Integrated Backup Explorer** | Inspect database tables, notes, bookmarks, and schema counts before and after merging. |
| 📲 **PWA & Mobile QR Pairing** | Built-in QR code modal for mobile camera scanning and Add to Home Screen support. |

## ⚖️ Comparison vs Third-Party Tools

| Feature | 🏆 JW Library Backup Merger (Web) | Legacy Desktop Tools (e.g. JWLMerge) |
|---|---|---|
| **Privacy & Zero Uploads** | ✅ 100% In-Browser WebAssembly | ⚠️ Requires native OS installer (.exe/.jar) |
| **Multi-Paragraph Highlights** | ✅ **100% Heals all `BlockRange` spans** | ❌ Truncates to 1st paragraph (`BlockRange` bug) |
| **Mobile & iPad Support** | ✅ Yes (Mobile Safari, Chrome, PWA) | ❌ Desktop only |
| **Media Attachments (.png/.jpg)** | ✅ Fully preserved in output ZIP | ⚠️ Often dropped or skipped |
| **SHA-256 Hash Recalculation** | ✅ Automatic Web Crypto SHA-256 | ⚠️ Can fail on schema version mismatches |
| **Installation Required** | ❌ None (Runs in any browser) | ⚠️ Requires Java / .NET runtime |
